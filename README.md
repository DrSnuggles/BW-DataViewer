# Bloodwych Data Viewer

## Why

I did an IFF parser for audio/video a while back. See https://drsnuggles.github.io/IFF/

But there was no viewer for Bloodwych GFX files which are Atari ST raw file format.

Thanks to https://github.com/HoraceAndTheSpider/Bloodwych-68k/wiki i could manage to change that.

## GFX

Thats the new part done here.

## SFX

For playing back sounds i use my IFF/8SVX lib back from 2020.
